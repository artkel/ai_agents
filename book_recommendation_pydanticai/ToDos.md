Yes, excellent improvement suggestions, thank you.

I also have some ideas. Below, I drafted possible future steps.  Tell me what you think. Praise or constructive critic is very welcome!

* Different languages support (I read in mostly Russian, sometimes in German and English): Users can type inputs in any language, the model then translates into English for consistent search in Google Books and in its memory.
* Diversity in recommendations: Now the system suggests books only based on what I liked: same genres, moods, styles. What if I want to broaden my literature tastes, discover smth new??
* Check for duplicates: do not recommend what has already been recommended!
* Rename `book_repository.json` to `user_preferences_repository.json`
* consider adding a seasonal or mood-based option: "I'm looking for a summer beach read" or "I need something uplifting right now."
* Now the system only recommends famous novels and prize winners, not much classical literature suggestions
* Time Period Variation: Incorporate publication date as a factor to recommend both classic and contemporary works that match preferences
* Popularity Balancing: Add a feature to mix well-known books with "hidden gems" that match preferences but might be less widely read
* Fine-tuning Descriptions: Enhance the book descriptions to focus specifically on aspects most relevant to the user's preferences
* Possibility to provide only Title, or - optionally - also Title + Author
* **Complete application with UI**:
  1) In her First interaction with the app (authentification method needed to recognise users)
  2) User gets asked to provide min 5 book titles that she likes -> initial `user_preferences_repository.json` is populated
  3) After 5 titles have been added, the option "Get recommendation" becomes active
  4) User gets 3 recommendations based on her preferences (from diverse eras, time periods: must-read-classics, contemporary, prize-winners etc.)
  5) (!) and one extra recommendation to explore new genres, styles, moods, themes - books that are similar in one or (max) two dimensions **but different in all other dimensions**
  6) User has an option to mark suggested book(s) as "already read", also having an option to mark those as "liked". 
  7) Liked book is added to the book_repository.json; if a suggested book was marked as read but not liked, it goes to `do_not_recommend.json`. Books from this repo may not be recommended.
  8) All books shown in recommendations go into `book_recommendations.json`, where the system will check for duplicates 
  9) Before each recommendation, system checks for duplicates 1) in `book_recommendations.json` (already recommended), 2) in `do_not_recommend.json` (already read), 3) in `user_preferences_repository.json` (already read)
  9) User has an option to add the recommended book(s) into his reading list (`reading_list.json`)
  10) In the application, User always has an option to add more liked books to the `user_preferences_repository.json`
  11) User can click "Get recommendation" multiple times, each time receiving 3+1 new recommendations
  12) Earlier suggestions should be gradually deleted from the `book_recommendations.json` over time or upon reaching a certain json length (e.g. 50). As consequence, the earlier deleted titles can pop up as recommendations again.
  13) User can always access her `reading_list.json` to grab a title for her new book. She then can mark a title from the list as 1) read (goes to `do_not_recommend.json`) or 2) liked (goes to `user_preferences_repository.json`)
