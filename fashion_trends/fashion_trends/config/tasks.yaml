    Search the web for the latest women's fashion trends for 2025. Find exactly 3 distinct trends
    from different web sources. For each trend, provide:
    1. The EXACT name or title of the trend as written in the article - do not modify, paraphrase
       or rename the trend in any way
    2. Short description of this trend
    3. The complete URL of an article that discusses this trend in detail
    
    Important instructions for search:
    - Use broad search queries to discover trends, such as:
      * "Women fashion trends 2025"
      * "Female style forecast 2025"
      * "Latest women's fashion 2025"
      * "Women's clothing trends 2025"
      * "New women's style 2025"
    - DO NOT include specific website names in your search queries like Vogue, Elle, HarperBazar, Glamour, etc.
    - DO NOT include trend names in your search queries (since you're trying to discover them)
    - Search for trends on differen web sources, do not use the same web site to find all three trends there
    - Only AFTER finding articles with trend forecasts should you identify specific trend names
    
    Focus on fashion websites like Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Glamour, Vogue, WhoWhatWear or trend forecasting
    sites (avoid InStyle). Make sure the articles are about 2025 trends specifically, not older trends.
    
    Important: Copy the trend names EXACTLY as they appear in the article headings/titles. Do not
    create your own trend names or modify them.
    
    Format your output as a list with the trend name and URL for each trend.

    Analyze the fashion trend information from the URL: "{url}" for the trend "{trend_name}".
    DO NOT modify the URL - use exactly the URL provided.

    From the extracted content, provide the following:
    1. The EXACT trend title as it appears in the article
    2. The description of the trend, formatted nicely but using the EXACT text from the article
    3. Select the most relevant image URL that shows people/models wearing the trend (avoid product-only images)
    4. Include the source URL of the article

    For the image selection:
    - Important: Different fashion sites place images in different locations:
      * For nashvillelifestyles, always choose the image that appears before the trend title
      * For Vogue, always choose .png images when available
      * For other sites, examine all available images
    - Pay attention to any text that follows the IMAGE URL in the extracted content - this often contains descriptions
      like "From left: Brand X, Brand Y, Brand Z" or "Runway: Designer Spring 2025" which indicates runway/model images
    - Show real people or models wearing the trend (not product-only images)
    - Prioritize images that show fashion runway models or editorial photoshoots

    IMPORTANT: Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "trend_title": "The exact trend title from the article",
      "description": "The formatted description text from the article",
      "image_url": "The URL of the selected image",
